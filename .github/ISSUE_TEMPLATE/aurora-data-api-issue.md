<!--

Thank you for your interest in aurora-data-api. If you want to report an issue or make a feature request, you are in the right place. Please keep the following in mind:

- This project is staffed by volunteers who work on it in their spare time. Please respect the volunteers' time and effort by being courteous and kind. Users who abuse the goodwill of the volunteers will be removed from the project and barred from making further comments.
- This project provides an interface between open-source community-maintained software and commercial software. If your commercial enterprise requires the use of this software, the volunteers who maintain it are under no obligation to provide support to you; and moreover, it is your enterprise's moral obligation to support the maintainers. You can do so via the GitHub "Sponsor" button located at the top and bottom of GitHub's pages for this project.
- If you want general technical help, please ensure you have read and understood the documentation for the software this project builds upon. Issues that don't confirm that effort was taken to check the relevant documentation will be closed.
- If you wish to report a bug, please provide a single script that yields a complete standalone reproduction of the observed behavior, together with an explanation of the expected behavior and any citations that may be needed to support the expectation. Issues that don't provide this information will be closed.
- If you wish to make a feature request, please note that the maintainers' time is limited and you are invited to submit a pull request instead. Pull requests are expected to provide clean code, unit tests that cover the code and assert on the newly expected behavior, and documentation.
- If you are opening a pull request, it is your responsibility to run the full test suite on an RDS instance under your control, to confirm that the test suite passes with the proposed changes, and to post the full test output log. Unfortunately, because of the overhead associated with running a test RDS instance, this project does not currently have a CI pipeline capable of automating this step.

Thank you for contributing. You can delete this text to edit your issue content.
